! IMPORTANT : all our CPML codes work fine in single precision as well (which is significantly faster).
!             If you want you can thus force automatic conversion to single precision at compile time
!             or change all the declarations and constants in the code from double precision to single.

! CeCILL FREE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT
!
!     Notice
!
! This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result
! of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with
! the two main principles guiding its drafting:
!
!     * firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
!       of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to
!       users,
!     * secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which
!       it is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and
!       intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers to
!       both authors and holders of the economic rights over software.
!
! The authors of the CeCILL (for Ce[a] C[nrs] I[nria] L[ogiciel] L[ibre])

!
! However, the Licensor is entitled to offer this type of services. The
! terms and conditions of such technical assistance, and/or such
! maintenance, shall be set forth in a separate instrument. Only the
! Licensor offering said maintenance and/or technical assistance services
! shall incur liability therefor.

! agree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data,
! loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders,
! opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all
! legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party,
! shall constitute consequential loss and shall not provide entitlement to
! any or all compensation from the Licensor.
!
!     Article 9 - WARRANTY
!
! 9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical
! state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all
! possible uses to be tested and verified, nor for the presence of
! possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's
! attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,
! modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are
! reserved for experienced users.
!
! The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means,
! the suitability of the product for its requirements, its good working
! order, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons
! or properties.
!
! 9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled
! to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the
! rights set forth in Article 5).
!
! 9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied "as is" by
! the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than
! that provided for in Article 9.2 and, in particular, without any warranty
! as to its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant
! nature.
!
! Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free
! from any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will
! be compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software
! configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.
!
! 9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the
! Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
! relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,
! the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee
! arising out of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be
! instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the
! Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against
! the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal
! assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be
! decided on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the
